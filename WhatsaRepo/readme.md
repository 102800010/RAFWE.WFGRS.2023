# What is a Github Repository?
A repository, or 'repo' for short, is essentially a home for two things: 
1) All of the files for your research project.
2) All of the revision history for each file.

This is awesome, because it serves as both a backup for your data, as well as a space for collaboration with others that you're working with.

**For this portion of the workshop, I'll give a brief tour of some of my repos. The goal is just to show you why I find them so valuable, and hopefully you'll see how helpful they can be for your research.**

There's a lot of sources of information about github, so I don't want to reinvent the wheel. This [site](www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/turorials/what-is-a-git-repository) is a good resource for understanding more about the basic information about what repositories are, as well as beginner, intermediate, and advanced tutorials.
