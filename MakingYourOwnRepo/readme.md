# It's time to make your own repo!

Ok, let's start by making a very basic, introductory repo together. You can use this template for your own repos later on!

First, let's start by making a repo, and creating our first folder, file, and commit in it!

Click on the green 'new' button in the top left of your screen.

This should open up a window for creating your very own repository! It should look like this, and you'll need to enter a name for it. You can also add a description, choose whether it's public or private, and add a README file (you'll notice this is a recurring theme). Type in a name

Ok great! You did it, you should see this now, with the repo name after your username in the rop left, and the readme markdown file being the only file.

Ok, hit that little pen to the far right of the README.md file, that should open up the ability to code it in the markdown syntax. Here I wrote a little note, and then updated the header under 'commit changes'

Now, if I want to see the main repo, back from the folder I created, I click on the name of the folder
