# Here we'll learn about what makes github repos so useful, the ability to backup data and move seamlessly between workstations
Well, we've made a repo, but what can we *do* with it? 

Well, one thing we can do is make new files on our local machine, and then 'push' them to our repository, so we can later 'pull' them on another machine.

Let's do that! 

The first thing we'll need to do is open up google desktop, and click on the top left spot where it says 'current repository'

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.1.jpg?raw=true)

---

Ok, click on 'add', and select the repository that you just made, edit the local path to where you want it on your local machine, and hit clone

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.2.jpg?raw=true)

---

You should now see the name of your repository listed as your current repository, and everything else is blank, because there's no changes and it's linked up to the most current version

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.3.jpg?raw=true)

---

Now, open your file explorer of choice. Navigate to the repo, and create a new folder. Name it whatever you want.

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.4.jpg?raw=true)

---

Import some data into this folder, or, alternatively, right click and make a new word file (or whatever really)

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.5.jpg?raw=true)

---

Now, open up github desktop. It should automatically notice that there's changes, but just to be sure, click the 'fetch origin' button

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.6.jpg?raw=true)

---

Ok, we want to make sure the changes that we made are updated to our online repo. Here you'll need to edit your 'commit' message. This tracks what you did each time you update your repo. I typed 'imported data into a new folder' right above the 'commit to main' button, but you can type whatever you want. Go ahead and type something that describes what you did, and click 'commit'

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.7.jpg?raw=true)

---

Ok great! **BUT it's not done yet!!** You have to now make sure you 'push' this change to the origin repo. Go ahead and hit the 'push origin' button.

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.8.jpg?raw=true)

---

You should now see github desktop showing that it's just good to go, no local changes are detected

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.9.jpg?raw=true)

---

Go back online to github, and look at your repo. You should see that new folder!

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.10.jpg?raw=true)

---

Click on the folder, and you'll see your data file, as well as the commit message!!

![PushPull](https://github.com/rhyacotritonriot/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023/blob/main/image.files/pushpull.11.jpg?raw=true)

---

## That's it, you did it!
