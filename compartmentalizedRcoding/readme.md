# Compartmentalized R Coding and Github
Ok, we've made a repo, cloned it to our PC, made local changes, and then pushed those changes to github. That's awesome, we're doing big things, look at us go!

We can still go a step beyond, and compartmentalize our R coding within our repo to be even more efficient for downstream analysis, and sharing with collaborators.
